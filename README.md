# My CTF writeups

This repository contains writeups to some challenges that i solved during various CTFs. All the CTFs i participated in are listed on my [ctftime profile](https://ctftime.org/user/38259). Some CTFs are missing from this repo as i have done no writeups for them.

In my writeups i try to focus on my train of thought in addition to just the solution itself. I mostly do writeups for challenges that i found particularly fun or that taught me new stuff.
